<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88054163/159171923-fc65b5cf-8c7d-47d6-8d97-91bb6091dfdf.png"> <br>

### Case Introduction
Help the team of <a href="https://springact.org"> Spring ACT – Action. Compassion. Technology. – </a> empower people to take action and help eliminate global social injustices.

Social injustice such as sexism are part of the lives of many people every day. In order to change this, one key aspect is to empower individuals to understand what their options are and what they can do to take action in face of the injustice. So how do we get the information to people in need, how do we motivate people to learn about their options, share them with others? How do we get content providers and associations to contribute to such a platform?


### Case Pitch
Help non-profit organization Spring ACT to create a sustainable business model and a solution prototype that will help peoplpe take concrete action in the face of injustice.
We’re envisioning a gamified approach to deliver a personalised educational experience (think e.g. DuoLingo) that helps people to learn how to deal with everyday’s social injustice, such as how to best react to sexism, racism, as well as, fight the imposter syndrome.
The solution should motivate individuals to keep studying the most relevant topics and “growing”, while being able to proudly share learning achievements and connect with a wider community.
It's crucial to create a business model that generates sustainable revenue streams in order to fund development and operational costs of the solution. 

Other current projects of Spring ACT include "[Sophia](https://springact.org/sophia-chatbot/)" – the world's first chatbot empowering survivors of domestic violence; and "[Dots](https://springact.org/dots-legal-aid-app/)" – an alternative legal aid app.
 
### Deep Dive Slides
We’re looking for these things: 
-	A mobile-usable app prototype (web / native / PWA) with a good UX that focuses on the needs of people in vulnerable situations. 
-	A Learning feature (e.g. like Duolingo) to learn about topics of social injustice and what to do in these situations, where to find help etc.
-	A safe & secure approach to involve the broader community, share information 
-	An engaging gamification approach (e.g. using an Avatar, Badges etc..) that motivates people to keep learning and educating themselves and share knowledge.
-	A business model – e.g. how can content production, app development and operational costs be sustainably financed, given that the solution will be provided by a non-profit organisation for free to users?

Ideally, we would love to see a working demo (mobile), but teams can also decide focus more on the business model and UX e.g. with a clickable prototype (Figma etc.).


### Further Information
Our **VISION** is to empower people to take action and help eliminate global social injustices.
Our **MISSION** is to collaborate with partners across borders and industries to connect people in vulnerable situations to the resources they require.
Our **PURPOSE** to provide assistance to those in need through innovative solutions. <br>

Help us develop a new tool that fits into everyone's pocket and bag, so they are ready to fight day to day injustice at moment's notice.

### Resources
We encourage you to use the Microsoft Azure Cloud services and Open Source libraries of your choice for the technical prototype. You can use any language & popular tech stack that you feel comfortable e.g. Python, JS/TS, Java, C# or APIs, as long as it will be technically possible to deploy it on the Azure Cloud later.
Microsoft will provide a limited amount of free Azure Credits for the event.


### Judging Criteria
We will assess the solution on the basis of various areas:

- Creativity / Novelty (is it new? Is it solving the business problem in a creative, fresh and engaging way?)
- Technical Feasibility (can it be done with a small tech team? Does it require “expensive” resources? Is the architecture sound? Does it support necessary requirements (e.g. offline capabilities, hardened security etc.), Does it use established tech stack and Open Source vs. obscure and fringe stuff / unnecessary vendor dependencies) 
- Business Model (did you think about the BMC? Does it make sense? Are your assumptions realistic?) 
- User Experience (does it have a great UX? Does it look intuitive and appropriate for the target audience? Did you invest a bit into artwork / graphics?)
- Pitch quality (comprehensive, structured, engaging, inspiring-but-no-BS  etc…)
- Working demo vs. Mockup (working demos always gets bonus points)
