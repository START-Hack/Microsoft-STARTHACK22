# START Hack 2022 - Microsoft Case 

### Case Introduction
Help the team of Spring ACT – Action. Compassion. Technology. – empower people to take action and help eliminate global social injustices.

Social injustice such as sexism are unfortunately part of the lives of many people every day. In order to change this, one key aspect is to empower people in vulnerable situations to understand what their options are and what they can do to get help and protect themselves.
So how do we get the information to people in need, how do we motivate people to learn about their options, share them with others? How do we get content providers and associations to contribute to such a platform?


### Case Pitch

### Deep Dive Slides
We’re looking for these things: 
-	A mobile-usable app prototype (web /native / PWA) with a good UX that focuses on the needs of people in vulnerable situations. 
-	A Learning feature (e.g. like Duolingo) to learn about topics of social injustice and what to do in these situations, where to find help etc.
-	A safe & secure approach to involve the broader community, share information 
-	An engaging gamification approach (e.g. using an Avatar, Badges etc..) that motivates people to keep learning and educating themselves and share knowledge.
-	A business model – e.g. how can content production, app development and operational costs be sustainably financed, given that the solution will be provided by a non-profit organisation for free to users?

Ideally, we would love to see an working demo (web app or mobile), but teams can also decide focus more on the business model and UX e.g. with a clickable prototype (Figma etc.)


### Further Information
Insert any further information about the hack case, the topic and related projects.
Give as much context as possible, in order to give your coders a head start!

### Resources
We encourage you to use the Microsoft Azure Cloud services and Open Source libraries of your choice for the technical prototype. You can use any language & popular tech stack that you feel comfortable e.g. Python, JS/TS, Java, C# or APIs, as long as it will be technically possible to deploy it on the Azure Cloud later.
Microsoft will provide a limited amount of free Azure Credits for the event.
